    Request that a new Project be created. The result is an Operation which
    can be used to track the creation process. It is automatically deleted
    after a few hours, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation.

    Our SLO permits Project creation to take up to 30 seconds at the 90th
    percentile. As of 2016-08-29, we are observing 6 seconds 50th percentile
    latency. 95th percentile latency is around 11 seconds. We recommend
    polling at the 5th second with an exponential backoff.

- name: Google Cloud Resource Manager API Delete Project
  x-api-slug: google-cloud-resource-manager-api
  description: |-
    Marks the Project identified by the specified
    `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion.
    This method will only affect the Project if the following criteria are met:

    + The Project does not have a billing account associated with it.
    + The Project has a lifecycle state of
    ACTIVE.

    This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from
    ACTIVE
    to DELETE_REQUESTED.
    The deletion starts at an unspecified time,
    at which point the Project is no longer accessible.

    Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state
    checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject,
    and the Project remains visible to ListProjects.
    However, you cannot update the project.

    After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by
    the  GetProject and
    ListProjects methods.

    The caller must have modify permissions for this Project.
